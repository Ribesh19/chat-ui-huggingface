### 26) Circle the shapes that have the same area:  

**Rectangle A:**  
```
┌───────────────┐
│               │  4 cm
│               │
└───────────────┘
   8 cm
```
Area = \( 8 	imes 4 = 32 \, 	ext{cm}^2 \)

**Square:**  
```
┌─────────┐
│         │  6 cm
│         │
└─────────┘
   6 cm

```
┌───────┐
│       │  9 cm
│       │
